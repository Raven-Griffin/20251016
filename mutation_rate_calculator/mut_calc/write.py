    """
    Write sequence IDs and sequences into a file in FASTA format.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ids : List[str]
        List of sequence identifiers (e.g., ["Seq1", "Seq2"]).
    sequences : List[str]
        List of corresponding sequences (e.g., ["ATGCC", "GATTACA"]).
    filepath : str
        Path to the output FASTA file.

    Returns
    -------
    None

    Notes
    -----
    - Each sequence is written as:
          >ID
          SEQUENCE
    - Sequences are automatically uppercased and stripped of whitespace.
    - The function assumes `len(ids) == len(sequences)`.
