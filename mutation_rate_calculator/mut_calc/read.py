    Read sequences from a FASTA file and return them as a formatted string.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filepath : str
        Path to the FASTA file.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        A formatted string where each sequence entry is represented by two lines:
        - Line 1: Sequence ID (no description, only the ID).
        - Line 2: Sequence (single line, uppercase).

    Notes
    -----
    - Uses only regular expressions for parsing.
    - Sequence lines are joined and uppercased.
    - Example output for two sequences:

        >ID1
        ATGCGTAC
        >ID2
        GATTACA
