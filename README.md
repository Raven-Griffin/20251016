In this project, aligned nucleotide sequences (generated using tools such as MAFFT) are analyzed to calculate pairwise mutation rates relative to a reference sequence.
Each sequence alignment represents homologous regions among related species, strains, or experimental samples. The alignment process ensures that equivalent nucleotides are compared across positions, allowing for meaningful mutation statistics.
The resulting data provide:
Mutation counts and mutation rates for each sequence relative to a defined reference.
Quantitative insight into how much each sequence has diverged from the reference.
A reproducible workflow for mutation rate calculation using Python and Pandas.
